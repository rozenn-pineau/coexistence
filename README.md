# coexistence
This repository holds the scripts used to generate the figures (in R and Matlab) and to run the model (Matlab). 

# Experiments (Figures 1,2 and 5)
  - Run Main_Figure1.R with the corresponding datasets (ancestor_radius.txt, large_radius.txt, small_radius.txt and panel-c-aspect-ratio.R) to generate Figure 1. 
  - Run F2 with the corresponding dataset (rawdt_for_plot_interpolationNAs_filtered.txt) to generate Figure 2.
  - Run Main_Figure5.R with the corresponding datasets (see raw data excel file) to generate Figure 5.

# Model (Figures 3 and 4)
  - Run create_figure_coexistence_zones.m to generate Figure 3. 
  - Run stepbystepinvasion.m to generate Figure 4.
